BUILDING GUIDE

This is a step-by-step guide to assist you on building your own Son√≤graf, based on the materials list we provide.
It will give as a result an "exact" clone of the unit we designed, but of course, you can add your own upgrades and improvements to the unit!

This building guide has been carefully crafted and contributed by Filippo Centenari (https://www.filippocentenari.it/)

If you make a cool upgrade to the unit, and you are able to provide an alternative building guide (a video tutorial would be amazing!), we're open to receive and publish your contribution!
