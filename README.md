This is a compilation of software, materials list, 3d print files, CNC designs and instructions for you to build your own Sonògraf.

Please be aware that the software (a Raspberry PI 4 image file) is complete and fully working, as this constitutes the fundamental element of the Sonògraf instrument.
The source codes for the software components are provided, if you feel brave enough to analyze, make sense of the package and make your custom modifications.

Please find the software elements of the Sonògraf, including a release featuring a ready-to-burn Raspberry Pi .img file here: https://github.com/PlaymodesStudio/Sonograf_Software

(please note that we provide 2 different images: a shrinked one, hosted in github, and a complete one, hosted in Dropbox. Some people has had errors with the shrinked image, so we recommend to go directly to the full .img with the dropbox link)

The 3D prints and CNC files are provided as a mere starting point for your own project, and shouldn’t be taken as fabrication-ready:

-Some of the material listed elements can be discontinued (specific products out of stock or not being fabricated anymore)

-The 3D printing and CNC files are provided in a variety of formats (svg, ai, stl…) and you must carefully check that the designs match your materials.

-Some assembly images can give you a reference on how we did it. But, again, this can be useful or not depending on your specific design and materials availability.

-You will need some level of understanding on basic electronics (ie: wire a knob or button to an rpi adc), and be patient enough to guess how to put everything together at the hardware and software level.

-Some extra designs are provided: logotypes, pieces for collage composition…

-As of June 2024, Filippo Centenari (https://www.filippocentenari.it/) has graciously contributed with a step-by-step assembly guide. It is a very well documented PDF with all the needed stepes to follow for the set-up of a Sonògraf. Thank you Filippo!

-A user manual and educational guide is also provided, in spanish and catalan. Sorry, no english translation yet! (If you want to contribute with an English translation of the educational guide, or with a new one with your own experience, in english, this will be a highly appreciated contribution!)

Although we can’t provide personal support or guidance for possible problems with this package, we always welcome feedback and we are eager to know if you succesfully built your own version of the Sonògraf.
